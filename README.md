### Project Description
A **Habit Tracker** is a tool to monitor daily routines, build good habits, and stay consistent. It helps track progress, set goals, and stay motivated using checklists, streaks, and reminders. üöÄ

### The Problem statement
Many individuals struggle with maintaining consistency in building positive habits or breaking bad ones due to lack of motivation, accountability, and progress tracking. A structured habit tracker provides a simple and effective way to monitor daily routines, stay disciplined, and achieve long-term personal goals.
### The Solution
The habit tracker gamifies progress by growing a virtual tree as users complete habits. It boosts motivation with visual growth, progress tracking, and celebratory rewards like confetti and music. üå±‚û°üå≥
